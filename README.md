# Ben Allen | Software Engineer

Independent contractor specializing in modern Python architectures and high-performance tooling. I enjoy the intersection of **Python and Rust**, and leveraging tools like `uv` and `ruff` to build scalable, maintainable systems.

### 🛠 Tech Stack & Philosophy

- **Core:** Python (Expert), Rust (Exploring/Interop), Vue.js and NUXT.js, FastAPI.
- **Tooling:** I use `uv` for all dependency management and environment isolation. I advocate for the "Rust-ification" of Python tooling to improve $DX$ and execution speed.
- **Architectures:** Asynchronous systems, OCR/Document processing, and full-stack API design.
